lab1a.c
This file contains the source code for the program. The first part of the program handles the --shell option.
 
The next part of the program corresponds to part 1 of the spec and reads from STDIN and writes to STDOUT until the
 escape character ^D is entered from the terminal. 

The next part of the program corresponds to part 2 of the spec and passes input/output between the terminal and
a shell.
	Firstly, I fork a new process. I have the child process redirect IO and use execlp to have the process
 run /bin/bash. The parent process then creates a thread which reads input from the shell pipe and writes it
to STDOUT. The other thread reads input from the keyboard and echoes it to STDOUT and the shell.

I also have a signal handler that exits with code 1 if it detects a SIGPIPE. 

Makefile
This is the makefile for this project and has three targets:
default: This compiles and creates the executable lab1a using gcc and the -pthread and -g options
clean: This removes any files that weren't in the directory initially such as the built executable and the
	tarball
dist: This builds the tarball with the necessary delivarable files

README
This file describes each the deliverable files
